## How to work?
The triple screen project we have developed provides video streaming in parallel.
This project consists of four basic structures;
- Interface is designed using Qt Creator. (C++, Python)
- OpenCV library that allows us to manipulate the image.
- DroidCam application that provides network access to phone camera.
- Parallel processing of the video is provided by using Multithreading to provide video streaming.
